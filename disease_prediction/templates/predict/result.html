                          <p>All carbs affect blood glucose levels so it’s important to know which foods contain <a href="">carbohydrates</a>. Choose the healthier foods that contain carbs and be aware of your portion sizes.</p>
                          <p>Here are some healthy sources of carbohydrate:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>whole grains like brown rice, buckwheat and whole oats</li>

                              <li>pulses such as chickpeas, beans and lentils</li>
                              <li>dairy like unsweetened yoghurt and milk.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>At the same time, it’s also important to cut down on foods low in fibre such as white bread, white rice and <a href="">highly-processed cereals</a>. You can check food labels when you’re looking for foods high in fibre if you’re unsure.</p>

                          <p>Eating lots of <a href="">salt</a> can increase your risk of <a href="">high blood pressure</a>, which in turn increases risk of heart diseases and stroke. And when you have diabetes, you’re already more at risk of all of these conditions.</p>
                          <p>Try to limit yourself to a maximum of 6g (one teaspoonful) of salt a day. Lots of pre-packaged foods already contain salt so remember to check food labels and choose those with less salt. Cooking from scratch will help you keep an eye on how much salt you’re eating. You can also get creative and swap out salt for different types of herbs and spices to add that extra flavour.</p>

                          <p>If you’re cutting down on carbs, you might start to have bigger portions of meat to fill you up. But it’s not a good idea to do this with <a href="">red and processed meat</a>, like ham, bacon, sausages, beef and lamb. These all have links with heart problems and cancers.</p>
                          <p>Try swapping red and processed meat for these:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>pulses such as beans and lentils</li>

                          </ul>
                          <p>Beans, peas and lentils are also very high in <a href="">fibre</a> and don’t affect your blood glucose levels too much – making them a great swap for processed and red meat and keeping you feeling full. Most of us know that fish is good for us, but oily fish like salmon and mackerel are even better. These are rich in something called omega-3 oil, which helps protect your heart. Try and aim to eat two portions of oily fish a week.</p>

                        <p>You might be wondering about fruit and if you should avoid it because it’s <a href="">sugary</a>? The answer is no. Whole fruit is good for everyone and if you have diabetes, it’s no different. Fruits do contain sugar, but it’s natural sugar. This is different to the added sugar (also known as free sugars) that are in things like chocolate, biscuits and cakes.</p>
                        <p>Products like fruit juices also count as added sugar, so go for whole fruit instead. This can be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned (in juice, not in syrup). And it’s best to eat it throughout the day instead of one bigger portion in one go.</p>

                        <p>We all need <a href="">fat</a> in our diet because it gives us energy. But different types of fat affect our health in different ways.</p>
                        <p>Healthier fats are in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily fish, olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Some <a href="">saturated fats</a> can increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart problems. These are mainly found in animal products and prepared food like:</p>

                        <p>We know <a href="">cutting out sugar</a> can be really hard at the beginning, so small practical swaps are a good starting point when you’re trying to cut down on excess sugar. Swapping sugary drinks, energy drinks and fruit juices with water, plain milk, or tea and coffee without sugar can be a good start.</p>
                        <p>Cutting out these added sugars can help you manage your blood glucose levels and help you manage your weight. You can always try low or zero-calorie <a href="">sweeteners</a> (also known as artificial or non-sugar sweeteners) to help you cut back. These can also be helpful for weight loss in the short term if you don’t swap for other foods and drinks containing lots of calories. But, in the long term, try and reduce the overall sweetness in your diet.</p>
